                                        Most of the software written at Amazon
                                        is backed by a data store, somewhere.
                                        Many of the challenges engineers face
                                        arise when figuring out how to most

                                        This is a relatively long list of topics
                                        to review, and might seem somewhat
                                        overwhelming. Your interviewers won’t be
                                        evaluating your ability to memorize all
                                        of the details about each of these
                                        topics. What they will be looking for is
                                        your ability to apply what you know to
                                        solve problems efficiently and
                                        effectively.

                                        prepare for a technical interview,
                                        practicing coding outside of an IDE and
                                        reviewing CS fundamentals will likely
                                        yield the best results for your time.

                                        Be prepared to discuss technologies
                                        listed on your resume. For example, if
                                        you list Java or Python as technical
                                        competencies, you should expect
                                        technical question about your experience
                                        with these technologies. It’s also
                                        helpful to review the job description
                                        before your interview to align your
                                        qualifications against the job’s
                                        specific requirements and

                                        want the interview process to be
                                        collaborative; and want to learn what it
                                        would be like to work with you on a
                                        day-to-day basis in our open
                                        environment.

                                        If you are asked a question, but not
                                        given enough information to solve the
                                        problem, drill down to get the
                                        information that you need. Sometimes
                                        information is deliberately withheld,
                                        and knowing what is missing is part of
                                        the actual interview; sometimes it is
                                        just a mistake by the interviewer.

                                        Either way, ask what you need to know to
                                        solve the problem· If that information
                                        isn’t available, focus on how you would
                                        attempt to solve the problem given the
                                        limited information you have. Sometimes
                                        we have to make quick decisions based on
                                        some of the relevant data.

                                        When answering questions, be as concise
                                        and detailed in your response as
                                        possible. It’s hard to gauge how much
                                        information is too much versus not
                                        sufficient enough; so pause after your
                                        succinct response to ask if you’ve
                                        provided enough detail, or if the
                                        interviewer would like you to go into
                                        more depth.

                                        Interviewers also appreciate an
                                        opportunity to share their thoughts and
                                        experiences, so take a moment to prepare
                                        a couple of questions for the
                                        interviewer. These could include
                                        technical questions if you weren’t sure
                                        about an answer during the interviews;
                                        but also ask whatever questions you have
                                        which you want answered to help you with
                                        YOUR decision :)

                                        Also - be an expert in what you do every
                                        day. If you’re not, it’s likely the
                                        interviewer will decide your ramp up to
                                        learn new things will be severe.

                                        in those situations, the journey can
                                        carry just as much weight as actually
